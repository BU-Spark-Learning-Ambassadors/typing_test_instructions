# Typing Test Challenge

## What is a micro-challenge?
- A micro-challenge is a small coding project designed to be completed within a few hours to two days. It serves as a focused task that promotes learning and innovation. Micro-challenges are suitable for individuals of varying experience levels, offering a range of difficulty to cater to different skill sets.

## Difficulty = ‚≠êÔ∏è

## What you will build:
- In this micro-challenge, you will create a Python-based Typing Test game. The game will present users with a choice of difficulty levels, each containing a set of sentences to type. Users will be timed as they type the provided passage, and the program will provide feedback on accuracy and typing speed.

## How you will build it:
- You will use Python to implement the Typing Test game. The game will include different difficulty levels, each with its set of sentences. User input will be timed, and the program will calculate accuracy and words per minute. The code involves string manipulation, user input handling, and basic time calculations.

## Duration:
- This micro-challenge is designed to be completed in approximately 2-4 hours, depending on your experience level.

# Instructions
## üöÄ Setup

### Clone this repo to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BU-Spark-Learning-Ambassadors/typing_test_instructions.git
cd typing_test_instructions
```

## üèÜ Challenge

Your task is to implement a basic Typing Test game in Python. Follow these steps:

1. Choose a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) before starting the typing test.
2. Present the user with a passage based on the chosen difficulty level.
3. Implement a timer to measure the time taken for the user to type the given passage.
4. Calculate accuracy by comparing the user's input to the provided passage.
5. Display the user's typing speed in words per minute.

## üöÄ Build Upon

To make the challenge more interesting and complex, consider the following enhancements:

- Allow users to choose passages in different languages.
- Incorporate a countdown timer or set time limits for the typing test to add a time-bound aspect.
- Implement additional difficulty levels with more challenging passages.
- Create a user-friendly interface for the game using a GUI library like Tkinter (look out for this in a future challenge!)

Feel free to explore other creative features that enhance the overall user experience and challenge level.
